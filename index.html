				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>My name is Lauren and I am 38 (yea, i know, If you've seen my pic, i dont look even close to my age)! I have been a NU'EST fan since debut but I joined the community in the summer of 2017 after the finale of P101. I had not had good experiences with fandoms in the past, so i pretty much stayed to myself. <br>
<br>
In my spare time, I DJ for an internet radio station (siradio.fm) and I have a set where I play only Jpop and Kpop (usually Thursdays nights EST). I pretty much like/know most groups. I got into kpop around 2010 and Ive been into jpop since I was little. <br>
<br>
There is more information in the MISC section. </p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What GO's will you open?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>I will primarily open GO's for NU'EST, Monsta X, Wanna One, P101, and JBJ. If there is something of interest, I am not opposed to opening a GO (or individual order) for any other group. </p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Do you take requests?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>As I am just starting out, I only have I/Os open. If there is enough interest in an item, I may open a GO. But for now GOs are closed.  If you would like me to do an interest check on an item, please DM or CC me.<br>
<br><strong>NOTE: </strong> If you see a CAN/USA GO and feel uncomfortable having your item shipped from CAN, I will be willing to take your order as an I/O. Fansites havent allowed me to open a GO for the US when there is one for CAN/US. (I've tried)
</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Which countries do you ship to?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>I am only willing to ship within the US. It is where I am most comfortable at the moment. <br>
<br>
Please note that I am not able to calculate shipping rates until I have the item in hand, so please do not ask how much the shipping will cost before then.

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Important things to note!</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p> Check your emails!
						
						 Always use Friends and Family on PayPal. Goods and Services charges a fee in paypal and I will refund your payment. Also, Do not write ANYTHING in the Notes section.<br>

 <br> GOS will never include EMS or domestic fees unless otherwise noted.<br>
 <br>

			<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>Group Order Info</h2></li>
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Group Orders, How do they work?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>When a group order is requested, I will ask the seller or fansite if they are open to an overseas orders and if there are any other group orders open for the US. If there is a group order already open, I will not open one. Please do not request I open a GO, when there is already a USA GO open.<br>
<br>
Once I get permission to open a GO, I will tweet the details of the item (cost, etc) and open a form. The form will close 1-2 days before the deadline just in case something goes wrong with the deposit. Once I close the form, I send the first payment to the fansite/seller. If there is a minimum to the GO and I dont hit it, I will refund everyone. <br>
						<br>
Now is the waiting game. The seller or fansite will have the goods in production and when they are done, they will ship the goods to my korean address. Once the goods arrive at my korean address, I will send out an EMS estimate which I will split amoungst the buyers.<br>
<br>
As soon as every buyer has paid the EMS fee, I will send the payment to the korean address (warehouse) and the goods will be shipped to my house in Massachusetts. Once the goods arrive at my house, I will weigh and calculate the domestic shipping for each buyer and send out an email with the rate(s).
<br>
<br>
Once the buyer pays the domestiv shipping fee, I will ship the goods!</p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How does your Korean Address and Korean account work?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>I set up my Korean account through Korgou; this is how I manage my bank transfers to sellers/fansites. I know there are others who also use Sendhow, but it seems they charge a paypal fee and bank transfer fee, and I didnt want using that account to be more expensive.<br>
<br>
<br>
For my korean address, I also use Korgou. This is a warehouse where the goods arrive and are sorted by ID. They are placed into inventory by my ID number until I am ready to combine the goods for a shipment to my house in the US. As a part of the warehouse services, I am provided with an address to use.

GOM = Group Order Manager<br>
I/O = Individual Order<br>
EMS = Express Mail Service; This is a shipping service.<br>
DHL = This is a shipping service comparable to EMS, but can be pricey. </p>

			<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>Individual Orders</h2></li>
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What are individual orders (I/Os)?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Individual orders are orders where there are only 1 or possibly 2 buyers involved instead of multiple buyers. </p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How do I/Os work?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Here is the process for I/Os:
					<br><br>

					1: Using the I/O form, the order is placed. NOTE: Make sure to place the order WELL BEFORE the deadline; if the deadline is on the weekend in Korea, the latest you can submit an order for it is Thursday (EST) that same week. PLEASE BE AWARE OF TIME ZONES! S.Korea is 14h ahead of EST.
					<br><br>
					2: I will review your order and confirm the details (availability, deadline). If there is an issue with the order (availability, deadline, or other), I will DM you. If the order looks good, I will send you a confirmation email tha includes the price of the order in USD and the korean domestic shipping (if applicable).
					<br><br>
					3: Once I receive the money, I will deposit/pay for the item(s), then place the order (fill out the order form or place the order with the fansite directly).
					<br><br>
					4: Once goods have shipped and arrive at my Korean address, I will wait until there are enough other goods so that EMS is cheap for you. This means your order might take longer (especially if I have to wait for more orders to reach my K-address). Please keep this in mind when you order. Please do not ask me for a time estimate because I can't give you one.
					<br><br>
					5: Once I know EMS, I send you an email. After it's paid, I will have the items shipped to me.
					<br><br>
					6: When items are at my house, I will send another email with a link to the domestic shipping form. After you fill it out, I will send an email with the USPS shipping rate. Once you pay your rate, I package and ship your item! (You must request, a different shipping method, if needed.)</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How are I/Os different from GOs?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>I/Os are less formal than GOs. There is no form for each item, rather you use the general <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/zSVxw21QXumyzjPb2" target="_blank">individual order form</a> to place an order and the payment info will be sent in a confirmation email.
						<br> <br>
					Unlike GOs, the price for an item in an I/O will include the domestic shipping fee within Korea (i.e. the fee for the item to be delivered to my warehouse) and the bank transfer fee.
					</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How long do I/Os take?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>This will depend on the goods ordered. If you ordered a doll, for example, it takes between 4 to 6 months. If you ordered a slogan, it can take between 1 to 2 months. Stickers and other small items can take up to a month. 
						<br><br>
						In addition to this, it can take up to a week or two after the I/O has arrived at my Korean warehouse for it to ship to my house because I have to wait until there are enough other goods so EMS/DHL is cheap for you.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Won't EMS fees be too high for I/Os?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>No, I will try to combine a lot of orders before shipping to my house; that way EMS/DHL will be cheaper.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>


			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Where can I see updates on my I/O?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Please check the masterlist <a href="https://trello.com/b/J4KD7v1j" target="_blank">HERE</a> before contacting me. If the update you are looking for is not there, please contact me.</p>

			<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>Payments</h2></li>
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What are my payment options?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>I accept PayPal (<a href="paypal.me/pixyl" target="_blank">htp://paypal.me/pixyl</a>) and Venmo (<a href="http://venmo.com/pixyl" target="_blank">venmo.com/pixyl</a>) only. <br>
<br>
NOTE: I only accept FRIEND AND FAMILY on PayPal. If you do not choose this option, I will refund your payment.
					</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">When submitting the form, do I need to pay immediately?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>No, you have until the deadline to pay. Although, it is prefered if you pay when submitting the form. This way I can make sure that the money is deposited into my korean bank account in time for the deposit to the fansite. <br>
<br>
For I/Os, I will send a confirmation email with the total required payment. It is prefered that you pay when you recieve the confirmation email. <br>
<br>
If you do not pay before the deadline, your order will be dropped, so please pay attention to everything written in the confirmation emails. Do not ask to make an exception. <br><br>
						</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why do you require Friends and Family for Paypal?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The IRS has been known to target accounts that receive a lot of Goods and Services payments and sometimes PayPal locks accounts which means the money there cannot be used. This is why I insist on Friends and Family for buyers. </p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What happens if I miss a payment?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>If you miss the 1st payment, then I will drop you from the order or cancel your I/O. <br>
<br>
If you missed the 2nd payment, I will withhold your goods and you have to wait until I sell them in order to get a refund. If this happens, you will not be able to order from me again. Reason for this is that I cannot hunt down those who havent paid. 
					</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>


		

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I sent the wrong or double payment, can I get a refurn for the difference?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Yes! Please reply to your confirmation email with proof of the incorrect payment, and I will fix the discrepancy as soon as possible.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What other groups do you listen to?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>I think this is the most difficult thing you can ask a DJ. I listen to most groups and my music collection is pretty ridiculous. As I have been with alot of groups since debut since 2010, I cant really list out all the groups since then. (this would turn into a novel)<br>
<br>
When I DJ, I (try) make spotify playlists for those sets, so if others want to listen they can. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/djpixyl" target="_blank">HERE</a> is my spotify account. <br>
<br>
But to give you an idea, my music collection consists of over 450 groups, not including subunits and is about 80GB currently. (this is just Korean, dont get me started on Japanese, Anime, etc.)<br>
<br>
Im rambling, but my current playlist (most of these are full albums or discogs and it gets added to constantly) consists of... Block B, BTOB, BTS, EXO, GOT7, JBJ, JJ Project, SVT, Longguo & Shihyun, Monsta X (& No Mercy), NU'EST, P101, Red Velvet, Suzy, Unpretty Rapstar, Zion T., Seo In Guk, Zico, NCT 127, KARD, Cheetah, 2NE1, BAP, Mad Clown, Day6, Hotshot, Twice, Be.A, The Unit, Heize, Hyeongseop & Euiwoong, Sewoon, Jeon Soyeon, Wanna One, Giriboy, Vixx, Sunmi, f(x), Chungha.
